# [DIGITARIUM](digitarium.ml)

Website was converted from Wordpress using [Jekyll Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/).  
A good tutorial can be found here: [4 Steps To Migrate From WordPress To Jekyll](https://blog.webjeda.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-migration/).  
Now it is a static web site managed with Jekyll.
 
Based on [LOFFER](https://fromendworld.github.io/LOFFER/) theme.
